# Projects

My name is Leen Madani and I am a student enrolled in the Master of Biotechnology program (Digital Health Technologies stream) at the University of Toronto. 

This repository contains projects that I worked on, either individually or with a team, throughout my master year. If project is done with teams, then this will be clearly indicated. 

The projects are relevant to data science in health predominantly, where I attempt to answer a research question through a thorough analysis of a dataset. 
The process involves data cleaning and the usage of a lot of statistical techniques (regression models, survival analysis, machine learning, classification, etc..). 

If you have any questions, please email me at leen.madani@mail.utoronto.ca
