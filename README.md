# Hangman-Project-Solo-


My name is Leen Madani and I am a student enrolled in the Master of Biotechnology program (Digital Health Technologies stream) at the University of Toronto.

My repositories contain projects that I worked on throughout my master's year. If the project is done with teams, then this will be clearly indicated.

The projects are primarily relevant to data science in health, where I attempt to answer a research question through a thorough analysis of a dataset. The process involves data cleaning and the usage of a lot of statistical techniques (regression models, survival analysis, machine learning, classification, etc..).

If you have any questions, please email me at leen.madani@mail.utoronto.ca
